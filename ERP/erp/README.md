   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/erp
   ```
   
   If you don't create this file, the app will use the default MongoDB URI.

3. **Start MongoDB**
   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:
   ```bash
   # Using MongoDB service
   brew services start mongodb-community
   
   # Or start MongoDB directly

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests!

the erp portal looks very poor, the tables shown are just displaying the json. But i want you to understand each data and design the UI accordingly, make a sidebar SHOWING THH EFEATURES IN THE ERP . Ex: for Attendance use the data to be displayed in a monthly calendar like UI. foR TIMETABLES DISPLAY THEM AS GRID LIKE INTERFACE. SO, UBDERSTAND EACH DATA AND DISPLAY THEM ACCORDLINGLY IN A MODERN WAY. DO IT ONW BY ONE, NO ISSUES
